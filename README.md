# GRC_Phishing_Security_Awareness_Program


**Presenter**: CyberSecHazaa
**Category**: Cybersecurity GRC | Security Awareness | Presentation
**Tools**: Excel/Google Sheets, Articles 

---

**Context/Scenario (All made up)**:
	An upcoming medical facility by the name of Wall Health with domain @wallhealth.com, they have nurses, doctors, ER, janitors, security officers, etc and they would like to have their employees to get educated on latest hacks & security threats by a Cybersecurity professional. 


---

**Overview**
	Phishing is company's worst nightmare. Who doesn't want to go on a free vacation? Who doesn't want free gift-cards or electronic devices 80% off. Everyone does. However, it's one of those things that if it sounds too good to be true then it most likely is. Sometimes the email coming from your boss looks real, it's imperative to check the domain, the name of your boss. It's also imperative to stop and think "why is my boss asking for my password credentials?" The sooner you ask yourself, the less likely you''ll be a victim to phishing attacks. 

---

**Objectives** 
- Improve employee's understanding and awareness to combat phishing and/or social engineering attacks.
- Educate about security awareness with relevant content.
- Break down complex data/technical into simple terms

**Vocab**: 
- Phishing/Spoofing: Unsolicited email, text messages or phone calls that disguise themselves as legitimate services in order to gain victims credentials, money, personal information, etc.  

**Key Components** 

**Phishing Simulation 1**: 
	From yourboss@gmail.com 
		**IMPORTANT** 
		All nurses are now required to have thei passwords sbmitted to the IT deparment via this email ITdeparment@gmail.com
		Best regards, 
		Your Boss

**Explanation**: Misspells is a one of the quickest thing to recognize that this is a phishing email, in a professional environment, it's an etiquette to have real spelling & clear context. Another way we can tell it's phishing, it comes from @gmail.com which is an external domain and not @wallhealth.com, which is the correct domain. 

**Phishing Simulation 2**: 
	From doctormanager@wallhealth.com
		**IMPORTANT** 
		Good Morning, 
		Doctors, you must register your patient through this new app we've created as it it's most secure.   
		Link: http:://10.27.27.72  

**Explanation**: Despite the correct email & domain, sometimes credentials are already breached without the user noticing. If a new app is needed, most likely it would've been already deployed/installed by you IT Team. Hence the reason why it's imperative to think first and report weird emails to the IT Team.  

**Phishing Simulation 3**: 
	From HR@wallhealth.com
		Good Morning, 
		Hospitals are commonly targeted by cyber threat actors. We're requiring every worker to do mandatory one hour education session with a Cybersecurity professional that will present to you about the topic. Please sign up here to get your session scheduled.

**Explanation**: This is real, we know it's real because of the domain, the correct grammar, clear context and a link that directs us to the company's website, it's not unreasonably urgent, neither it asks to provide some sort of the password to email back. 


**Metrics & Reporting** 
- The FBI 2024 reports that Phishing/Spoofing was the top cyber crime and how each different age groups are affected by it, financially.

**Explanation**: This graph shows us the age of the victims & the amount of complaints. This data lets us know how phishing is a growing problem in the U.S, of course taking into account that those complaints are only coming from people who made those reports, so we don't know how many phishing victims are out there, could be millions. People that 60+ would be considered at most risk. The truth, everyone is at risk. All it takes is one click, entering something sensitive into the website and that's it, you're pretty much compromised. Don't let the "free vacation" or "Click HERE! for amazon gift cards!". It's just too good to be true, I want to have free vacation and amazon gift cards too but eventually, it may lead to compromise. 

**Context**: 
- The report also mentions the amount of Data Breaches and Healthcare/Public Health happens to have **206** total breaches in 2024, it's the second most targeted field. For noticeable reasons too. Medical field contains sensitive data about patients.  
- The report mentions the decrease in phishing, 
	- 321,136 in **2022**
	- 298,878 in **2023**
	- 193,407 in **2024**
- Interestingly, 
	- $160,015,411 in **2022**
	- $18,728,550 in **2023**
	- $70,013,036 in **2024**

**Explanation**: Interestingly enough, we see the decrease in reports and the money loss. It seems like a good thing but it's just perhaps that last year, the FBI just didn't get enough reports, somehow there was less phishing that year (least likely scenario) we're talking almost 100k in complaints in difference. 

**Summary**: Finding a phish in the sea of bad actors isn't as hard if we stop and think for a second, checking the domain, the name, where the link may redirects. A little investigation of the email/text is all it takes to understand that the whether the delivery is malicious or not. If we spot something weird, it's best to report it to IT so other can be aware that the sender in question isn't friendly.
